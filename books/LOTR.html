                In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord,<br>
                forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring<br> 
                was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After<br>
                many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.</br>
                When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin<br>
                Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of<br>
                the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.<br>
                The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring:<br> 
                Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of<br>
                Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.
